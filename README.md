Did a full rewrite of this plugin. It is way more lightweight. Removed some features cause they were irrelevant. I hope you enjoy the new grapplinghook!

Simply plug and play, edit configurations in config.yml and messsages.yml, and simply reload in-game. There is no need to restart to update the config or messages.

Now you can use "any" item as a grappling hook in theory, and the default item is LEAD.

*requires Java 17

Features
- Power levels: Is used to increase speed of the arrow & increased velocity.

- Cooldown: Set a cooldown between uses.

- Fall damage: Negate fall damage, and don't kill players when landing after use of the grappling hook.

- Sound: on use you can decide what sound to use.

- Particles: Cute particles fired the same way as the arrow.

- Edit: all visible to player messages.

Commands
/skyline give <power level> <player>
/skyline reload
Permissions:
skyline.use - to allow users to use the skyline hook.
skyline.admin - for access to commands.
